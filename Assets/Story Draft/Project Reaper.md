A persistent pain thumps in my head as I come to.

I try to get up but can't seem to. There is something preventing me from getting up.

Or moving. Or anything, really.

A billion lights exploded as I opened my eyes. Then all went dark.

My eyes slowly adjusted to the darkness as I felt around. I seemed to be in a plastic bag.

I took out a sharp blade from my pocket and set out to cutting myself free.

Any normal person wouldn't have a knife.

But I wasn't any normal person.

I was a private detective.

As soon as I cut through the plastic, mounds of mud came rushing through the gap, straight to my face.

As I coughed and spluttered, I realised where I was.

I was in a grave.

The thumping in my head wouldn't go away, but I finally remembered some of the events of the past 12 hours.

None of the events ended well for me.

But somehow I felt that being in a grave vindicated my credentials as a private detective.

I tore open the bag and stepped out, dusting off the mud. I stood up inside the grave and looked around.

It wasn't that deep. Around 5feet by 4. With a depth of 5 and a half feet. I could look outside if I stood on my tiptoes.

The torn plastic bag lay at my feet, with mud scattered around it.

They had done a pretty crappy job of trying to bury me.

I couldn't blame them.

They did a pretty bad job of killing me too.

But the damned headb thumping wouldn't go away.

I hoisted myself out of the grave and onto the grassy ground.

Then I saw why I had only been half buried.

The guy supposed to bury me had been a burly person with a balding head and a permanent scowl on his face.

I say had because now he was very dead.

Rudely interrupted during his burial duties, I figured from the shovel in his hand.

I looked around. Graves in all the three directions, and the sea on the other one.

I dropped down on my knee and searched the dead man. He had a gun in his packet, a wallet, a lighter and a couple of cigarettes.

I took everything.

Then I stood up again and I kicked the dead man.

I'm petty that way.

Then I studied the dead man. From the way he was lying down, I think the shot must've come from my left.

I slowly moved to my left, carefully examining all the things around me.

Then I saw it.

Two parallel Tyre tracks. Leading towards the entrance.

I cocked the gun and stared at the tracks.

Then I started to follow the tracks.
